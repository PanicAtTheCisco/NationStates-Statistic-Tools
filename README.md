## NationStates Statistic Tools
* A collection of tools I made to keep track of and monitor the statistics of both my nation and that of the nations in my region

### nation-regional-rankings.py
* Returns the current statistic rankings of a single nation in their region

## TODO
* Create tool for getting historical trends for a single nation
* Create tools for pulling stats and historical trends for all nations in a region (with rate limiting to avoid API issues)
* Add graphing features to tools for visual comparisons
